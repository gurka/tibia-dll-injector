tibia-dll-injector
==================
I'm to lazy to write a complete README, but here a few pointers for those of you that found this repository:

* This project was created with the intent to learn how DLL injection works and what can be done with it.
* This project was not created to be used in any kind of cheat for Tibia, but if you want to use it for that: do it.
* (void*)0x7f34da8b   (heh)
* Read the code if you want to know how it works. Most of it should be self-explanatory, as code should be. You might want to peek at the comments too.
* Create an issue or email me if you find something horribly incorrect in the code.
